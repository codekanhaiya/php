                        <p class="card-text">A meningioma tumor can be a severe condition, as it typically occurs on the
                            brain, which means it causes a number of other serious conditions. In most cases, these
                            tumors can grow slowly or quickly, depending on the classification of being benign or
                            cancerous. Fortunately, around 90% of these tumors are benign. However, just because they
                            are benign doesn’t mean they can’t cause complications, especially if they continue to grow
                            at a steady pace.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Diagnosing a meningioma brain tumor can be difficult. If an individual has
                            a meningioma tumor, he or she may have no symptoms and require no immediate treatment.
                            Different factors in the diagnosis, including position and size, will set the course for
                            treatment.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">If you have been diagnosed with a meningioma or have brain tumor symptoms
                            that seem to be unexplained, the knowledgeable team at Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh is here
                            to help. We feel it essential to always educate individuals on brain-related conditions so
                            they can make the best decisions in relation to care and treatment.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As with any medical diagnosis, there are lots of questions. Learn more
                            about meningioma brain tumors by checking out the answers to commonly asked questions.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">WHAT ARE MENINGIOMA BRAIN TUMORS?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">This type of tumor forms on the membranes of the brain and spinal cord,
                            inside the skull. The membranes it grows on are called meninges, hence its name. Meningioma
                            occurrences are the most common central nervous system tumors. They affect more women than
                            men. While most tumors are classified as benign or malignant, some meningiomas are atypical,
                            which indicates they could turn into cancer. Only a small percentage are cancerous. Those
                            that are, however, do grow fast. They can then spread to other areas of the body, like the
                            lungs.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The causes of these tumors are not completely known, however, there are
                            risk factors, including exposure to radiation and Neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic
                            disorder. Additional research has seen a possible correlation between previous injury and
                            meningiomas. Other research suggests a link between the hormone progesterone and the
                            development of these tumors.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">WHAT ARE SOME OF THE COMMON SYMPTOMS?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">As noted earlier, most of these tumors are benign and grow slowly, so many
                            times there are no symptoms. The symptoms may also be confused with other medical issues. If
                            an individual does have symptoms, they are most commonly:</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Headaches</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Seizures</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Blurred vision</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Weakness in the arms or legs</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Numbness</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Speech difficulties</p>


                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">HOW IS A MENINGIOMA DIAGNOSED?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">The diagnosis of a meningioma rarely occurs before symptoms are noticeable.
                            If you have symptoms, the first thing a doctor may order is a brain scan, either an MRI or a
                            CT scan. With these scans, a doctor will be able to identify a tumor and its size. </p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MENINGIOMA TUMORS?</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">First, if the tumor has not resulted in any significant symptoms, doctor
                            may recommend close observation with regular brain scans to monitor the tumor’s growth.
                            Should the tumor begin to cause problems or continue to grow, surgery may be required.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The type of surgery to remove the tumor would be a craniotomy. This
                            involves removing a piece of bone from the skull, which allows the neurosurgeon access to
                            the area of the brain where the tumor is located. Then the tumor is removed, and the bone
                            put back in its place. The position of the tumor has much to do with how the surgeon can
                            access the brain.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Sometimes because of its location, surgery isn’t possible, so radiation
                            therapy is used instead to help shrink the tumor and prevent it from growing larger. If it’s
                            malignant, then radiation will also kill the cancer cells.</p>
