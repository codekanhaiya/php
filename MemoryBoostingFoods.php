                        <p class="card-text">Eating an adequate diet is beneficial for both mental and physical health.
                            The brain
                            plays the role of a
                            command center in our body, and just like every other body part, the brain also requires
                            some specific
                            nutrients to work
                            efficiently. By incorporating specific nutrients into our everyday diet, we can improve our
                            memory and
                            focus.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Everyone must include healthy foods in his or her nutritional regime to
                            maximise the
                            capability
                            of the brain. The Foods below are preventive foods and help boost brain health.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Top 10 Memory-Boosting Foods</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Here are 10 memory-boosting foods that can significantly boost memory and
                            focus. Take a
                            look!</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Blueberries</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Blueberries are an excellent source of antioxidants such as anthocyanins,
                            tannins,
                            resveratrol, and
                            proanthocyanidins. Including blueberries in your diet boosts memory and concentration
                            because the
                            antioxidants stimulate oxygen
                            and blood flow to the brain and help in keeping the mind fresh. In addition to improving
                            focus,
                            blueberries also protect
                            against certain heart diseases, dementia, and cancer</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Green Leafy Vegetables</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">As a food source that is rich in antioxidants and carotenoids, green leafy
                            vegetables
                            boost brain memory and
                            focus while protecting it from various conditions. They also contain Vitamin B which is
                            exceptionally good
                            at promoting overall
                            brain health, power, and memory. Some dark green leafy vegetables like spinach, turnip
                            greens, and okra
                            have high amounts of
                            folic acid which improves mental clarity. People with neurological disorders must include
                            these
                            memory-boosting foods in their
                            diet.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Avocados</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Avocados have high levels of monosaturated fats which keep blood sugar
                            levels in
                            control. As one of the
                            healthiest fruits, avocados contain folate and vitamin K in high amounts which prevent blood
                            clots (a
                            possible stroke) and
                            improve cognitive function.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Pumpkin Seeds</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Containing powerful antioxidants, pumpkin seeds protect the brain from
                            getting damaged
                            by free radicals.
                            Apart from that, they are a rich source of iron, zinc, magnesium, and copper. These four
                            elements are
                            responsible for
                            stimulating several functions inside the brain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Iron helps in clearing out brain fog and improves function</li>
                            <li>Zinc from pumpkin seeds enhances nerve signalling, and its deficiency has been linked
                                with
                                neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and depression.
                            </li>
                            <li>Magnesium boosts memory and learning and is highly beneficial for people with epilepsy.
                            </li>
                            <li>Copper aids the nerve signals and people with copper deficiency are at a higher risk of
                                disorders like Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Fatty Fish</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Fatty fish is often called brain food because it is rich in omega-3 fatty
                            acids. The
                            human brain is made of
                            up to 60% of fat, and almost 50% of that fat is omega-3. Fishes like trout, salmon, and
                            sardine can be
                            included in the daily
                            diet as one of the foods that improve memory.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Dark Chocolate</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">All of us have a craving for dark chocolates, isn’t it? These rich in
                            magnesium
                            chocolates stimulate the
                            release of serotonin and endorphins, which heightens the mood and boosts memory. This makes
                            them one of
                            the promising foods that
                            improve memory and concentration. However, one should not have dark chocolates in excess as
                            it is rich in
                            caffeine.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Eggs</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Eggs are a good source of several nutrients that make them one of the
                            promising foods
                            that improve memory
                            and concentration. Eggs consist of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid. These nutrients
                            help to delay
                            cognitive decline
                            and prevent brain shrinkage.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Soy</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Soybean products comprise polyphenols that are popular for their
                            antioxidant activity.
                            These antioxidants
                            are responsible for a reduced risk of dementia. Also, polyphenols help to improve cognitive
                            abilities
                            associated with the
                            regular aging processes. These polyphenols consist of isoflavones which contribute to
                            antioxidants in the
                            body.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Flax Seeds</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Like other memory-boosting foods, flax seeds are rich in magnesium, omega-3
                            fatty
                            acids, magnesium, and vitamin B.
                            Mixing flax seeds into whole grains and then consuming them, allows the body to absorb them
                            easily. You
                            must consult a neurologist to
                            know the required quantity of flax seeds for your body before you consume them to avoid
                            serious brain
                            disorders.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title blogH5">Turmeric</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Turmeric is a common household spice in India and is used extensively in
                            most dishes.
                            Curcumin, an active
                            ingredient in turmeric is linked to improving memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease.
                            However, more
                            than that curcumin helps
                            new brain cells to grow. It also slows down age-related mental decline. Curcumin can
                            directly enter the
                            brain, breaking the
                            blood-brain barrier.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">By including these foods mentioned above in your everyday diet, you can not
                            only
